# CRAG-MM Search APIs

CRAG-MM is a visual question-answering benchmark that focuses on factuality of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It offers a unique collection of image and question-answering sets to enable comprehensive assessment of wearable devices.

## CRAG-MM Search API Description

The CRAG-MM Search API is a Python library that provides a unified interface for searching images and text. It supports both image and text queries, and can be used to retrieve relevant information from a given set of retrieved contents.

The *image search* API uses CLIP embeddings to encode the images. It takes an image or an image url as input and returns a list of similar images with the relevant information about the entities contained in the image. Similarity is determined by cosine similarity of the embeddings. See *Search for images* below for an example.

The *web search* API uses chromadb full text search to build an index for pre-fetched web search results. It takes a text query as input, and returns relevant webpage urls and meta data such as page title and page snippets. You can download the webpage content based on the urls and use the information to build Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Here, relevancy of the webpages are calculated based on cosine similarity. See *Search for text queries* below for an example.

## Installation

```bash
pip install cragmm-search-pipeline==0.4.0
```

## Usage

### Task 1
```python
from cragmm_search.search import UnifiedSearchPipeline

# initiate image search API only, web search API is not enabled for Task 1
search_pipeline = UnifiedSearchPipeline(
    image_model_name="openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336",
    image_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/image-search-index-validation",
)
```

### Task 2 & 3

```python
from cragmm_search.search import UnifiedSearchPipeline

# initiate both image and web search API
search_pipeline = UnifiedSearchPipeline(
    image_model_name="openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336",
    image_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/image-search-index-validation",
    text_model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    web_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/web-search-index-validation",
)

# optional, can specify the tag of the index. default is "main". we recommend always use default / "main".
search_pipeline = UnifiedSearchPipeline(
    image_model_name="openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336",
    image_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/image-search-index-validation",
    image_hf_dataset_tag="v0.4",
    text_model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    web_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/web-search-index-validation",
    web_hf_dataset_tag="v0.4",
)
```


### Search for images

```python
# use PIL image as input (alternatively, can use image_url as input)
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/The_Beekman_tower_1_%286214362763%29.jpg"
headers = {"User-Agent": "CRAGBot/v0.0.1"}
response = requests.get(image_url, stream=True, timeout=10, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
    results = search_pipeline(image, k = 2)
    assert results is not None, "No results found"
    print(f"Image search results for: '{image_url}'\n")
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        print('\n')
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve image. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

Other recent polling shows that this theory might not be right. A trio of late March polls put Cuomo at around 40 percent, suggesting that since entering the race, Cuomo has, if anything, increased his lead — that he was, in fact, becoming if not better known, at least better liked. The Cuomo campaign can scarcely believe their good fortune — as much as Cuomo likes to deride his opponents as far-left members of the Democratic Socialists of America, Mamdani, whose viral online videos have turned him into a phenom in the early part of the campaign, actually is a member of the group. It is the belief among several of Cuomo’s advisers that Mamdani can’t possibly break 50 percent but that he could win over the left and deprive oxygen and attention from Cuomo’s other competitors, creating a dynamic much like Cuomo faced when he ran statewide against Zephyr Teachout and Cynthia Nixon, both candidates beloved by the progressive left but with little traction beyond it.', 'page_url': 'https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-does-andrew-cuomo-want-to-be-mayor-of-new-york-city.html'}
