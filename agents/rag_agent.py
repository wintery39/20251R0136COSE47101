    SimpleRAGAgent demonstrates all the basic components you will need to create your 
    RAG submission for the CRAG-MM benchmark.
    Note: This implementation is not tuned for performance, and is intended for demonstration purposes only.
    
    This agent enhances responses by retrieving relevant information through a search pipeline
    and incorporating that context when generating answers. It follows a two-step approach:
    1. First, batch-summarize all images to generate effective search terms
    2. Then, retrieve relevant information and incorporate it into the final prompts
    
    The agent leverages batched processing at every stage to maximize efficiency.
    
    Note:
        This agent requires a search_pipeline for RAG functionality. Without it,
        the agent will raise a ValueError during initialization.
    
    Attributes:
        search_pipeline (UnifiedSearchPipeline): Pipeline for searching relevant information.
