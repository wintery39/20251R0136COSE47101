    """
    BaseAgent is the abstract base class for all CRAG-MM benchmark agents.
    
    Any agent implementation for the CRAG-MM benchmark should inherit from this class
    and implement the required methods. The agent is responsible for generating responses
    to user queries, potentially using images and conversation history for context.
    
    The CRAG-MM evaluation framework evaluates agents on both single-turn and 
    multi-turn conversation tasks.
